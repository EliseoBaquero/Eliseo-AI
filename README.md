- ðŸ˜„ sporting feats always manage to capture my attention, but above all those that seem impossible for a team that reaches a record being one that did not have the best resources, that is why although I am not a fan [Bayer Leverkusen](https://www.bayer04.de/en-us) I have closely followed its development in the [Bundesliga](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga) 2023-2024, which they manage to win with an undefeated record, dethroning the unbeatable [Bayern Munich](https://fcbayern.com/en/).
The most notable thing is that they did not spend amounts of money like they do in other clubs in other leagues to get a title, this is related to one of my favorite movies ["Money Ball"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film))  where the manager of Oakland Athletics baseball team that has limitations Budget teams to compete hire players for their skills after analyzing their statistics in a different way than was traditionally done.
That's why these inspiring stories are my favorites, they show that analysis and decision making depend on many more factors than just money.
